# MATH123: Mathematical Aspects of Data Analysis Final Project
The goal of this project was to propose a twist on the handling of time-relevant data for k-means clustering. In the first method, I aggregated all data into a single data frame and performed classical k-means. In the second method, I applied k-means on each of the 3 datasets, aligned the groups based on centroid and reassigned each datapoint by merging the clusters.
